# jsformat
JavaScripts for formatting objects and text for display or printing. Some scripts may be used to format source code, though the scope is general text formatting.

## History
Originally, some of these were part of [scripts/format](//github.com/Quasic/scripts) and others started in various specialized projects of mine.
